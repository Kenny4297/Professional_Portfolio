            <p class="">Dedicated Web Developer with a passion for creativity! I enjoy helping others achieve their dreams by creating the best possible content for their businesses. I am currently shooting for a certification from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Bootcamp! <br><br>
            I absolutely love collaborating with others towards an end goal, while watching a seemingly impossible project come to fruition! <br><br> In my spare time you'll find me reading, playing chess, spending time with my two cats, and allocating a few hours a week keeping up with the newest trends and frameworks in the industry. While making a pivot from the hospitality industry, I bring along an importance toward the client and the team, understanding that nothing is possible without a positive attitude and successful communication towards both groups.</p>

                    <p>In all ages, Truth, poor thing, has been put to shame for being "a nuisance to humanity", and yet it is not her fault. She cannot assume the form of Error (human opinion), seated on its throne of world-wide sovereignty. So then, with a sigh, she looks up to her tutelage God, Time, who nods assurance to her future victory and glory, but who's wings beat the air so slowly with their mighty strokes, that the individual perishes before the inevitable day of triumph comes to her." <br><br>
